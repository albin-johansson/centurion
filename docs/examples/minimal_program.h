 *
 * The following is a minimal example of a valid Centurion program. All that is required
 * to initialize the library is to create an instance of the `library` class, which must
 * outlive the rest of your program, so it should be the first thing created in your
 * `main` function.
 *
 * \note The signature of the `main` function must be equivalent to `int(int, char**)`.
